      <h2>Programmer</h2>

      <p>
        I worked for 7 years in the finance area of ​​a mining company: Minera Alumbrera.
        I always wanted to learn how to code to develop my own tools for a business.
        In Tucumán there are many opportunities in this area. My future goal is to
        <strong>implement a new App</strong> in the city where I live.

                After a paragliding accident, Philippe, a rich aristocrat, is confined
                to his home. He employs Driss as home help. Driss is a young guy from the
                projects recently out of prison. In short, the person the least adapted for
                the job. Vivaldi and Earth, Wind and Fire, fine language and slang, suits and
                jogging outfits come together and a clash is inevitable. Two worlds collide
                and win each other over to give birth to a friendship as crazy, funny, and
                fierce as it is unexpected. A unique relationship that will make sparks fly
                and render Philippe and Driss untouchable.

                Charlie Fineman (Sandler) is a Manhattan dentist who lost his wife and two
                children when their jet crashed into the World Trade Center on 9/11. One day
                he runs into his old college roommate (Cheadle). Rekindling the friendship
                is the one thing that appears able to help the man recover from his grief.

              <p>
                In the near future, Computer hacker Neo is contacted by underground freedom
                fighters who explain that reality as he understands it is actually a complex
                computer simulation called the Matrix. Created by a malevolent Artificial
                Intelligence, the Matrix hides the truth from humanity, allowing them to live
                a convincing, simulated life in 1999 while machines grow and harvest people
                to use as an ongoing energy source. The leader of the freedom fighters,
                Morpheus, believes Neo is "The One" who will lead humanity to freedom and
                overthrow the machines. Together with Trinity, Neo and Morpheus fight against
                the machine's enslavement of humanity as Neo begins to believe and accept
                his role as "The One".
